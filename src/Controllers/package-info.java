/**
 * Package of the controller class.
 * <p>
 * The controller handles the user input, modifies the model, and decides what the view should draw.
 * <p>
 * This package should contain the view and controller interfaces, since they are required to use the controller.<br>
 * For example, there could be different view packages in the future, which all implement IView and use<br>
 * IController.
