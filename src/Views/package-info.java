/**
 * Package of the view classes.
 * The classes depend on the processing library to create a GUI.
 * <p>
 * The view decides how to display the game to the user.
 * The view should never have a reference to the model object or modify the model data directly.
 * Instead, it should communicate the user input to the controller, which handles this input.
